Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Ans: It is the complete process of designing and building a functional system in a systematic and reliable way.
It is important for creating platforms and software applications to ease certain processes and also provides satisfactions to users 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 Ans: The development of programming languages- This is what brought about the building of software
 the establishment of software engineering as a discipline - this is what borught about the idea of making it a norm to build software using certain methods
 the advent of structured programming - this gave form to the use of methodologies to develop software applications.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Ans:
Requirements- This is the identification of a problem and proper documentation also the needed methods to solve it 
Design- this is the detailed design of the solution(software) provide in order to determine the direction of the implementation. 
Implementation- this is the building of the solution. It is the coding phase. 
Testing- this is testing the solution made to ensure it fulfills its purpose and functionality.
Deployment- this is the release of the solution for usage.
Maintenance- This is the inspection for errors or bugs after the solution has been released

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Ans: Both methodologies divide the software development process into distinct phases or stages
Waterfall - in this method, provison of software solution is easier and faster as any challenge that arises would be tackled efficiently. WHILE
Agile - in this method, things are not done with an exact structure so confusion may arise on what next to do. Which would lead to waste of time and resourses. Though it is more flexible than the Waterfall. 
Waterfall - Building an aircraft control system
Agile - building a Mobile app for a startup

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Ans: Software Developer - He writes the codes and implements the software 
Quality Assurance Eng. - He ensures the quality of the software by carrying out tests 
Project manager - oversees the planning execution and delivery of the software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Ans: IDEs - They provide the tools for writing and debuggig a code eg. Visual Studio Code 
VCS - They help to monitor changes in codes and coordination eg. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Ans: Tight Deadlines, technical debt, changing requirements 
Strategies- prioritizing tasks, proper communication, regular reassessment.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Ans: 
Unit - Unit testing focuses on individual components or functions of the software. It helps in identifying and fixing bugs at the earliest stage of development, making it easier to resolve issues.
Integration - After individual components are tested, integration testing checks how these components work together. It helps in identifying issues that may arise when different parts of the system interact.
System - System testing evaluates the complete and integrated software to ensure it meets the specified requirements. It is critical for validating the overall functionality and performance of the software in a real-world environment.
Acceptance - Acceptance testing is done to verify whether the software meets the userâ€™s needs and requirements.This type of testing helps in gaining user confidence and ensuring customer satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Ans:
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses and results from AI models. 
A well-designed prompts help the AI generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Ans: 
"What are the benefits of exercise?" - vague 
"Describe the physical and mental health benefits of regular aerobic exercise, such as running or swimming, and how it contributes to overall well-being." - detailed and clear
The revised prompt is focused and detailed, asking for the benefits of a specific type of exercise and how it affects both physical and mental health. This leads to a more targeted and informative response.
